As a summer project with Christopher Hamilton, Baldur Björnsson and I assembled a heavy-lift drone with an infrared camera for geological surveys over the lava fields at the erupting volcano in Fagradalsfjall.
The drone has a 1.3m span and can carry up to 25kg.
[A document detailing the project is available here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fzUhJ0J-uqhVsV7xcRsQCw3uYpgGBdwt/view?usp=sharing)
The FLIR A65 outputs raw IR video that can be used to determine the temperature of the lava it is looking at.
It is a fairly heavy camera, so we have mounted it on a large gimbal.
The drone flew multiple test flights and multiple short, survey flights over the lava field, giving output images like at the top of this page.
