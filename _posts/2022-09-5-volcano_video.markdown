During the RAVEN fieldwork this summer (2022) there were lots of rumblings around the old crater 
Fagradalsfjall, which erupted in 2021 for a few months.
We eventually got the news, while still at Dreki, that the area had erupted for a second time.
These are some of the most polite volcanos that I have ever heard about - erupting away from people
and infrastructure, non-explosively, and mostly just creating great scenes.
Right after I got home from the fieldwork, Ellie and I took a trip to the new eruption that weekend.
I flew my Mavic 1 with its sketchy, old batteries and temperamental gimbal, and got the following
cheesy drone video.
