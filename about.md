My name is Joshua Springer.
I am a PhD student in computer science at Reykjavik University, studying autonomous drone control - and landing in particular.
My supervisor is Marcel Kyas, who initially proposed the topic to me during my master's program, and who has been supporting me since.
I am from Louisiana but moved to Sweden to start a master's degree in Intelligent Embedded Systems
at Mälardalen University in Västerås, Sweden,
and transferred after 1 year to Reykjavik University via the Nordic Master (NISS) program.
I graduated from both universities and began a PhD program at Reykjavik University immediately afterwards.
I have been building and operating drones in the Icelandic environment since then,
and have collaborated mostly with geologists in using them, particularly on analog missions,
but also filming the volcano in Fagradalsfjall.
